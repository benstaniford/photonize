All notable changes to Photonize will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Explorer Context Menu for Images**: Right-click on image files in Windows Explorer and select "Export to WebP" for immediate batch conversion to WebP format
- **Folder drag-and-drop**: Drag folders into other folders to move them, just like you can with photos

### Fixed
- **Selection state bug**: Fixed issue where selected photos from previously viewed folders would persist when switching directories, causing operations like WebP export to include wrong files
