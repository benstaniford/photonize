# Changelog

All notable changes to Photonize will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Image Compare Tool**: Select exactly two images and choose "Image Compare" from the right-click menu to open an A/B comparison window. Hover your mouse over the image and a vertical divider line appears, allowing you to interactively compare the two images side-by-side by moving the slider left and right
- **Explorer Context Menu for Images**: Right-click on image files in Windows Explorer and select "Export to WebP" for immediate batch conversion to WebP format (Note: selecting multiple files will open one instance per file)
- **Folder drag-and-drop**: Drag folders into other folders to move them, just like you can with photos

### Fixed
- **Selection state bug**: Fixed issue where selected photos from previously viewed folders would persist when switching directories, causing operations like WebP export to include wrong files
